Expectations were muted this time around.\nOn the fourth-quarter earnings call held in late October, CFO Luca Maestri  said the year-over-year growth in revenue would slow down in the December quarter.

The dollar has weakened since then, amid the Fed’s normalization of rates.\n“During the December quarter, we achieved a major milestone and are excited to report that we now have more than 2 billion active devices ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",
