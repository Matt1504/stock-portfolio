# Stock Portfolio Client 

## Overview
This project is the code that runs the front end client application for our Stock Portfolio application. It is written in TypeScript using ReactJS and Ant Deisgn library. The client uses Apollo Client to send GraphQL API requests to our backend web server. 

## Getting started
Make sure you have both the front end and the back end repos cloned to your local machine 

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/Matt1504/stock-portfolio-backend.git
git clone https://github.com/Matt1504/stock-portfolio
```

Follow the steps in the backend README to get your local web server up and running on the url [http://127.0.0.1:5002/graphql](http://127.0.0.1:5002/graphql)

Navigate to the cloned front end directory and make sure to install the packages and run the client 
```bash
cd stock-portfolio
npm install 
npm run start
```
